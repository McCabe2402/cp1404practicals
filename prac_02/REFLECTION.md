# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

60% I am catching up, slowed down due to tests of math subject.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I watch them at home with my main computer. I have access to two monitors so it becomes easy to 
work. I usually do it at around lunch time and/or dinner. I will watch about maybe 3 or 4 videos.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Getting a lot better at understanding and implementing code. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop relying on online resources to look for how a variable or python function works. I need to start using 
actual books from the library, since they might give me a better answer.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Time management and small mistakes. I am also not using the correct format I believe. Which I will try my hardest to 
learn.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Able to complete the practical without any errors at the end, not giving up.
